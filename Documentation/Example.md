# Example documentation

This is some example documentation.

If something isn't immediately obvious, you should consider writing it down in this directory. It's recommended that you have one file per subject (for example, one file for an IR seeking autonomous and another for an autonomous that simply drives off the ramp), but it's not required. Files should be sensibly named and written in [Markdown][1]. This is because Markdown is easy to read, easy to write, and gets rendered nicely on GitHub. You're highly encouraged to check out the [full Markdown syntax][2].
